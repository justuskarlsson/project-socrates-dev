Could you make a course in JSON format on "Intermediate Svelte, CSS and TailwindCSS". The students are experienced in the subject but want to explore it further.
The format should be:
{
  name: string,
  lessons: {name: string, description: string} []
}


I am a student on the course "". Today you hold a lesson for me on ""

## Language markdown
Could you make some flashcards related to the lesson?
The front and back should be styled with markdown, and the data in JSON. 
Each card should introduce a word, and be a sentence where that word is used. 
Here is the format:
front: "sentance word for word english literal translation with word highlighted\n\n actual translation in english italic"
back: "original sentence, word highlighted\n\n phonetic pronounciation for english speaker"
Here is an example:
[
{
  front: "can you **me** to please help\n\n*Can you please help me?*",
  back: "KÃ¶nnen Sie **mir** bitte helfen?\n\n*KERN-en zee meer BIT-tuh HELF-en*"
},
...
]
