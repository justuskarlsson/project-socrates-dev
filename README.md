# Project Socrates
> A learning platform using GPT-4 api

## Features
* Lesson planning - Create a course on a subject, and then add planned lesson sessions with a summary on what to go over. In each lesson session, the student/user will chat with the teacher (GPT-4) about the lesson subject. After the lesson is done, the teacher can quiz the student on the lesson content.
* Flashcards - Abillity to ask GPT-4 to create flashcards on the lesson subject. The student can then use the flashcards to learn. The flashcards use spaced repetion, so that the student won't forget glossaries in a couple of weeks.
* Mindmap mode - Abillity to have conversation topics spread out in a mind map using leaflet-js.
* Smart PDF documents - Upload pdf documents and do smart searches using GPT-4 and Token embeddings. 



## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
